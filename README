Ideally, this will act a lot like Slurpy. jansson and libcurl should be the only dependencies.

What works:
	> Search
	> Single Package Info
	> Downloading a taurball

TODO pile:
	> Extract taurballs
	> Specify alternate download directory
	> Check for existance of package in repos
	> Download dependencies
	> Update function (with download)
	> Colorize error messages (probably split off into errormsg func in util.c)
	> verbosity levels
	> Find 174 byte leak

Maybe pile:
	> Static link jansson
	> upload taurballs
