Ideally, this will act a lot like Slurpy, but powered by the awesomeness of C.

Dependencies:
	> jansson
	> curl
	> bsdtar
	> alpm (pacman)

What works:
	> Search package(s)
	> Info for package(s)
	> Download and extract package(s)
	> Check for updates (with download)

TODO pile:
	> Integrate ABS
	> Specify alternate download directory
	> Check for existance of package in repos
	> Download dependencies
	> verbosity levels
	> sort search results

Maybe pile:
	> Static link jansson (probably not)
	> upload taurballs
